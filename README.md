## Digit Classifier
* Classifies one digit against others using Perceptron and NCC.
* Compares the accuracy of Perceptron and NCC and visualizes the result.

## LDA
* Generates gaussian distributed data and applies LDA on this data.
* Compares the LDA result with Perceptron and NCC and visualizes the result.

## Hand Pose Regression
* Linear regression with optional ridge parameter to predict two dimensional hand positions from electromyographic (EMG) recordings.
* Polynomial regression with optional ridge parameter for same task.
* Visualizes performances with different values for hyperparameters.

## Kernels
* Kernel Ridge Regression to predict two dimensional hand positions from electromyographic (EMG) recordings.

## Trend Detection in Text
* Detects trends in text data with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
* Implementation of Linear Kernel PCA and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization(NMF).
* Plots the detected trends on both algorithms.
* Implements K-means on generated data.
